The vector u is: (2, 3, 4)
The vector v is: (4, 3, 4)
The vector w = u + v is: (6, 6, 8)
The vector y = u - v is: (-2, 0, 0)
The vector x = 8*u is: (16, 24, 32)

Attempt at dot product:
The dot product of u and v is = 33
Correct dot product: 33

Attempt at cross product:
The cross product of u and v is = (0, 8, -6)
Correct cross product: (0, 8, -6)

Attempt at calculating the magnitude:
The magnitude of u is 5.385
Correct magnitude: 5.385

Let's try to change the x-value of the u vector to 5
The vector u is: (5, 3, 4)

Let's try to read the z-value of the u vector
The z-value of the u-vector is: 4
