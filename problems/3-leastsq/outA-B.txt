The least squares fit gave the results:
lambda = -0.17138 +/- 0.00354
ln(a) = 4.95867 +/- 0.02984
The half-life is thus estimated to be 4.04 days
The table value half-life is 3.66 days

The uncertainty in the estimated halflife is 0.08 days
The estimated value does thus not match the modern value within the estimated uncertainty, but it is close.
